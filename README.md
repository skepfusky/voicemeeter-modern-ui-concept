# Voicemeeter Modern UI Concept

Voicemeeter is great and all, it's used by some studios, streamers, YouTubers - where in the 2020s!

The UI needs to be updated or should I say, _modernized_ from today's standards! This is merely just
a __concept__ as I've barely added any functionality at the time being as I have no idea how to send
stuff from Voicemeeter to an Electon app.
